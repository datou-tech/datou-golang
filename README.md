#### Summary

For technologists that may not be coding in GoLang on a daily basis, I want to create a project that can give a refresher within minutes on the basics. Then follow that up with recipes for commonly used functions as examples. 

#### Pre-requisite

1. Install go-lang `brew install golang`

#### Running the Project

| Command | Description | 
| -- | -- | 
| `go build main.go` | Build as a binary |
| `./main` | Run the main function as a binary  |
| `go run main.go` | Run the main function from code |
| `go test *.go` | Run the tests |

#### VSCode

- Install extension Go by "Go Team at Google"
